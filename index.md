## Welcome to **AP Stats in R**! 

This site is my attempt at providing a resource for former, current, and future teachers and students of AP Statistics to learn R. 

Throughout the different tutorials, I will show you how to use R to do the skills taught in the AP Statistics curriculum. Eventually, I may also add some other content. 

### Organization

This site is organized according to the chapters of _The Practice of Statistics, 4th Ed._ by Daren S. Starnes, Dan Yates, and David S. Moore. I don't use any actual content from the book, but I have organized it the same way in the hopes that that helps you understand how everything fits together.

### Style

The tutorial documents will include explanations of how things work, but also blocks of code like the following: 

```r
#first we calculate the average
average = (1+2+3+4+5)/5
#then we print it out
average
```

I'll do my best to break down these code segments so you know exactly what R is doing with different functions and operations.
